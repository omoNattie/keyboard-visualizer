# Before you install

This project is in beta, you can only use 1 or 2 letters per key as I cannot figure out how to make text dynamic.
I don't think I can even finish this project.

Also, this project was made for linux only, as windowsr has nohboard.
So don't bother if you use windows, nohboard is a million times better.

## Usage

```bash
keyboard -p ~/ProjectPath/Source/Data/Games/celeste.json -r default
```

### Installation

```git
git clone https://github.com/omoNattie/keyboard-visualizer
```

```bash
cd keyboard-visualizer
dotnet build

cd bin/Debug/net7.0

./keyboard --help
```
